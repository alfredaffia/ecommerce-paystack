Awesome Alfred! I took a look at your repo (it’s just the NestJS starter so far) and based on what a standard backend ecommerce application should look like, here’s a clear roadmap for what you need to build next — broken down step-by-step so it’s realistic and organized.

🎯 1. Define Your Core Domain (Backend Modules)

Every solid ecommerce backend typically has these core modules👇 — this is what your app should support next:

🧑‍💻 User Module

User signup/login (secure authentication)

Password hashing

Roles (user vs admin)

DTOs for profile updates
Why? You need users to place orders and manage accounts.

📦 Product Module (Catalog)

Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) products

Product variations (size, color)

Categories & tags

Stock quantity

Price, images, SKU

Goal: support product management for an online store.

🛒 Cart & Checkout Module

Add to cart

Remove from cart

Update quantities

Session-based or user cart

Calculate total amount

Validate stock before checkout

This lets users actually build an order.

💳 Payments (you already started)

Use Paystack integration (initialize, verify, webhooks)

Handle success + failure flows

Save transaction records

This connects payment logic to orders.

🛍️ Order Module

Create order from cart

Link payment status

Order statuses: Pending, Paid, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled

Save shipping info

Why? Without this, payments don’t become real orders.

📊 Admin Panel Logic

Backend endpoints for admin to:

Manage products

View orders

Change order status

See sales reports

Even if you build the frontend later, backend APIs need to exist.

🧠 2. Database & Relationships

Decide on a database (PostgreSQL recommended for ecommerce transactional data):

Tables you’ll want

Users

Products

ProductVariants

Carts

CartItems

Orders

OrderItems

Payments

Relationships are critical (e.g., one order → many order items).

🔐 3. Authentication & Security

Implement:

JWT auth (tokens)

Password hashing

Role-based guards (admin vs user)

Rate limiting

Input validation (DTOs)

Security is a must for ecommerce backend.

📦 4. Inventory Handling

When a user checks out or pays:

Reserve stock immediately

Decrement stock after payment

Prevent overselling

This logic should be atomic (transactional in DB) so multiple users don’t oversell items.

🚚 5. Shipping & Delivery Integration (Optional Next Step)

Later you can integrate:

Shipping APIs (calculate costs)

Tracking numbers

Delivery status updates

This comes after payments and orders are stable.

🧾 6. Notifications

Set up automated notifications:

Email/SMS for order placed

Payment confirmation

Shipping updates

You can use services like SendGrid, Mailgun or SMS providers.

📈 7. Extras / Nice to Have Later

Once core ecommerce backend works:

✔️ Coupon & discount system
✔️ Product search + filtering
✔️ Wishlist module
✔️ Reviews & ratings
✔️ Analytics endpoints (sales & traffic)
✔️ Admin dashboard UI (React/Vue)

These make your backend more complete and professional.

🔁 8. Testing & Quality Assurance

Write automated tests:

Unit tests

Integration tests (checkout, payment, order)

API tests

Testing ensures your backend doesn’t break in production.

🟢 9. Deployment & Scaling

After features:

Containerize (Docker)

CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Host on cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)

Use HTTPS, environment secrets

Scaling is important once users start arriving.

👣 Your Next Action List (Prioritized)

User authentication & roles

Product CRUD with stock control

Cart APIs

Order creation + status flow

Paystack integration (init + webhook + verify)

Payment-linked orders

Admin APIs

Email/SMS notifications

Testing + CI/CD

Deploy your API
